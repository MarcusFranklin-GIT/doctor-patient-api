# Appointment Cancellation Feature - Implementation Summary

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Appointment Schema**: Added `status` field with default value `'open'` and enum values `['open', 'canceled']`
- **File**: `src/doctor/schema/appoinment.schema.ts`

### 2. Backend Service Logic
- **AuthService**: Added `cancelAppointment()` method
- **File**: `src/auth/auth.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Validates appointment existence
  - Checks user authorization (doctors can cancel their appointments, patients can cancel theirs)
  - Prevents canceling already canceled appointments
  - Updates appointment status to 'canceled'
  - Updates corresponding slot status back to 'available'

### 3. API Endpoint
- **New Endpoint**: `DELETE /auth/appointments/:id`
- **File**: `src/auth/auth.controller.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Protected with JWT authentication
  - Accepts appointment ID as URL parameter
  - Returns cancellation confirmation

### 4. Module Configuration
- **AuthModule**: Added slot schema to MongooseModule imports
- **File**: `src/auth/auth.module.ts`
- **Added**: Slot model injection for service access

## üîß Technical Details

### Request Format
```http
DELETE /auth/appointments/:appointmentId
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "message": "Appointment canceled successfully",
  "appointmentId": "677d1234567890abcdef1234",
  "canceledBy": "patient"
}
```

### Database Changes
- **Appointment**: `status` changes from `'open'` to `'canceled'`
- **Slot**: `status` changes from `'booked'` to `'available'`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Authorization

### Access Control
- **Doctors**: Can only cancel appointments where `doctorId` matches their user ID
- **Patients**: Can only cancel appointments where `patientId` matches their user ID
- **JWT Required**: All requests must include valid JWT token

### Validation Rules
- Appointment must exist
- Appointment must have status 'open' (not already canceled)
- User must be authorized to cancel the specific appointment
- Cannot cancel the same appointment twice

## üß™ Testing Resources
