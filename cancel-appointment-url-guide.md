### How to Get Appointment ID

1. **Get your appointments first:**
   ```
   GET /auth/appointments
   ```

2. **Find the appointment you want to cancel and copy its `_id`:**
   ```json
   [
     {
       "_id": "677d1234567890abcdef1234",  // <-- This is the appointmentId
       "doctorId": "...",
       "patientId": "...",
       "slotId": "...",
       "status": "open"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Use that ID in the cancel URL:**
   ```
   DELETE /auth/appointments/677d1234567890abcdef1234
   ```

### Important Notes
- The appointment ID is a MongoDB ObjectId (24 character hex string)
- Only the doctor or patient involved in the appointment can cancel it
- Once canceled, the appointment cannot be canceled again
- When an appointment is canceled, the corresponding slot becomes available for booking again
